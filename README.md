Synchronizing video playback across multiple viewers in real-time, so that they all see the same frame simultaneously, is a challenging task, especially over the internet due to factors like network latency, buffering variations, and individual connection speeds. The strategy you're using with `checkBuffer` for handling buffer and playback speed can help with individual buffering issues but may not be sufficient for achieving precise synchronization across different viewers. Here are some strategies you could consider for better synchronization:

### 1. **Server-Side Time Syncing with Heartbeats**
   - **Description**: The server periodically sends the current target timestamp of the video to all connected clients. Clients adjust their playback position accordingly.
   - **Pros**: Achieves better synchronization across viewers.
   - **Cons**: High network traffic, and more complex to implement.
   - **Example Implementation**:
     - Server periodically emits a timestamp (e.g., using WebSockets).
     - Clients receive the timestamp and adjust their `currentTime` to match.

### 2. **WebRTC-Based Synchronization**
   - **Description**: Utilize WebRTC for low-latency peer-to-peer connections. You can send sync signals to keep videos aligned.
   - **Pros**: Low latency and better for real-time synchronization.
   - **Cons**: More complex setup, especially with scaling and connectivity issues (like NAT traversal).

### 3. **Centralized Clock Reference**
   - **Description**: Use a synchronized clock (e.g., NTP) as a central reference, and all clients play the video relative to the shared clock time.
   - **Pros**: Effective if users' clocks can be precisely synced.
   - **Cons**: Can still be impacted by network latency, and some platforms may add variable delays.

### 4. **Adjust Buffer and Playback Rate Dynamically**
   - **Description**: Continue to adjust buffer and playback rates but also use occasional hard "seek" corrections to realign the stream.
   - **Pros**: Can be combined with existing logic for minimal disruption.
   - **Cons**: May cause visible jumping or stuttering, less smooth.

### 5. **Use of Video Streaming Protocols with Synchronization Capabilities**
   - **Description**: Protocols such as HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) and DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) provide ways to sync segments, which can help.
   - **Pros**: Built-in features for segment-based synchronization.
   - **Cons**: Typically not frame-accurate, and latency can vary based on buffering policies.

### 6. **Custom Synchronization Protocol**
   - **Description**: Implement a custom protocol where all clients periodically "check-in" with a sync server and adjust their playback accordingly. If a client drifts too far from the desired timestamp, it seeks to the correct position.
   - **Pros**: Flexible and can be highly tuned.
   - **Cons**: Complex and requires careful tuning to minimize drift and visible corrections.

### Practical Strategy Recommendation:
A combination of **server-side heartbeats with periodic timestamp adjustments** and **buffer adjustments on the client side** might offer a robust approach:
1. **Server Sends Sync Messages**: Periodically broadcast the desired playback position to all connected clients.
2. **Clients Adjust Playback**: Clients adjust their position smoothly, speeding up, slowing down, or seeking as necessary to stay in sync.
3. **Buffer Management**: Continue managing buffer and playback rates dynamically to minimize stalling.

### Example Pseudocode:
```javascript
// On client
const syncInterval = 5000; // 5 seconds
let lastServerTime = null;

function receiveServerSync(timestamp) {
    lastServerTime = timestamp;
    const clientTime = player.currentTime();
    const drift = timestamp - clientTime;

    if (Math.abs(drift) > 0.5) {
        player.currentTime(timestamp); // Hard seek if drift is too large
    } else {
        player.playbackRate(1 + drift * 0.1); // Minor speed adjustments
    }
}

// Assume WebSocket connection receives periodic server sync
socket.on('sync', (data) => {
    receiveServerSync(data.timestamp);
});
```
